        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          VI3D Labs was established in 2017 with a clear mission: to transform
          how visual and surface inspections are performed across industrial
          sectors. The idea began with a fundamental question: what change could
          be made to inspection processes that would have the biggest impact?
          Through careful analysis, we identified that rethinking the tooling
          and methodology used in visual inspection campaigns could deliver
          major gains in both time and cost efficiency. With decades of
          experience in laser and visual technologies, we had the confidence
          that a breakthrough solution could be realized. Assembling a team of
          experts across optics, software, mechanical design, and systems
          integration, we began development of what would become a new category
          of industrial inspection tools.
          <br />
          <br />
          At VI3D Labs, our development journey has been driven by a commitment
          to rethink how visual and surface inspections are performed in
          industrial environments. Starting with a bold idea and deep domain
          knowledge in laser and visual technologies, we set out to build tools
          that would dramatically improve inspection efficiency, accuracy, and
          repeatability. Following the success of our initial prototype in 2019,
          we focused on refining the technology into a practical, deployable
          system. This led to the creation of our R-Series scanner, an essential
          platform that proved the core scanning concept under real industrial
          conditions. Through feedback and rigorous field testing, we identified
          opportunities for improved resolution, robustness, and automation.
          <br />
          <br />
          Building on this foundation, we developed the S-Series, integrating
          enhanced optics, motion control, and software capabilities. This
          iteration offered improved accuracy, user experience, and workflow
          integration. As adoption grew, so did the need for a more compact and
          adaptable solution, leading to the M-Series and P-Series, lighter,
          more modular scanners designed for difficult-to-access environments
          without compromising performance.
          <br />
          <br />
          Alongside the evolution of our scanners, we recognized the need for
          advanced tracking and targeting capabilities, which led to the
          development of the LTTS (Laser Target Tracking System). LTTS allows
          for precise and automated alignment with inspection targets, reducing
          operator variability and setup time while improving measurement
          reliability. Designed with scalability and portability in mind, LTTS
          enhances the value of all our scanner series by extending their
          usability in complex field conditions.
          <br />
          <br />
          Our iterative development process, from prototype to P-Series and LTTS
          has always been grounded in collaboration with industry, continuous
          innovation, and a drive to deliver tools that solve real-world
          problems. Each step forward reflects lessons learned, challenges
          overcome, and a growing confidence in our vision for the future of
          industrial inspection

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>
          With over a decade of experience, VI3D Labs and its leadership team
          have delivered specialized nuclear maintenance and inspection services
          across Canada and the United States, supporting field operations. Our
          expertise includes high-precision visual inspection, laser alignment
          systems, and the integration of advanced imaging technologies into
          regulated environments.
          <br />
          <br />
          Our product development history spans from concept generation to
          deployment of first-of-a-kind (FOAK) solutions. This includes the
          design, prototyping, and commercialization of next-generation 3D laser
          scanners purpose-built for industrial inspection. We successfully
          advanced from prototype (2019) to industry-ready product (2021), and
          validated system performance through partnership with a major industry
          member (2022).
          <br />
          <br />
          Our team's deep experience in regulated nuclear settings, combined
          with in-house engineering, optics, and software development
          capabilities, enables us to respond rapidly to unique field
          challenges. From developing custom tools for remote inspection to
          introducing automation through our Laser Target Tracking System
          (LTTS), we continue to deliver innovation that improves safety,
          reliability, and cost-efficiency in mission-critical environments.
