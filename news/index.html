          The EdgeSpec 3D Handheld is a compact, high-precision laser scanning
          system designed for sub-millimeter accuracy without the need for
          external references. It employs a proprietary 3D scanning process to
          deliver reliable, repeatable measurements for inspection and quality
          control, including use in Foreign Material Exclusion (FME) zones.
          <br />
          <br />
          Developed for industrial environments, the system is engineered to
          meet the highest quality standards. Its design prioritizes ease of use
          while delivering high-resolution data capture for detailed analysis.
          Consistency and precision are ensured under VI3D Labs' ISO 9001:2015
          certification.

          VI3D Labs Inc. Achieves ISO 9001:2015 Certification
        </h3>
        <p class="newsContent">
          VI3D Labs Inc. is proud to announce that, as of January 2025, we have
          officially achieved ISO 9001:2015 certification for our Quality
          Management System (QMS). This significant milestone reflects our
          continued commitment to delivering high-quality inspection
          technologies and services that meet the evolving needs of our clients
          across the manufacturing and quality assurance sectors.
          <br />
          <br />
          ISO 9001:2015 is an internationally recognized standard that sets out
          the criteria for a quality management system, emphasizing risk-based
          thinking, customer satisfaction, continuous improvement, and strong
          leadership. Earning this certification affirms that VI3D Labs operates

          “Achieving ISO 9001 certification is an important step forward for our
          company,” said Chris Bertoni, Co-Founder of VI3D Labs Inc. “It
          validates the rigorous quality practices we&#39;ve put in place and
          underscores our dedication to delivering reliable, high-performance
          systems like EdgeSpec. Our clients can be confident that we meet the
          highest standards in our industry.”​
          <br />
          <br />
          This certification applies to all aspects of VI3D Labs' operations,
          including the design, development, Services and support of our
          advanced 3D laser scanning solutions. It also reinforces our ongoing
          mission: to provide precise, easy-to-use inspection technology that
          enables manufacturers to maintain quality, reduce rework, and optimize
          production.
          <br />
          <br />

        <h3 class="newsHeading">New Space Research</h3>
        <p class="newsContent">
          <span class="bold">University of Alberta</span>
          <br />
          <br />
          VI3D Labs is working with the University of Alberta on exciting space
          research using data from the European Space Agency&#39;s Swarm
          satellites. These satellites measure electric and magnetic fields
          around Earth very precisely. With this data, we can learn more about
          how energy moves in the upper atmosphere (the ionosphere) and how
          space weather affects Earth. Our focus is on studying certain waves,
          called EMIC waves, which may cause sudden drops in the number of
          high-energy electrons trapped in space near Earth, in a region known
          as the Van Allen belts.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span class="bold">European Space Agency</span>
          <br />
          <br />
          Satellites and astronauts in space are affected by harmful,
          high-energy particles, especially so-called “killer electrons” in
          Earth&#39;s radiation belts. These particles can damage satellite
          electronics and systems. Their numbers can change dramatically in just
          a few hours, so predicting them is critical for space safety. One way
          these dangerous electrons are lost is through interaction with to
          space plasma waves called EMIC waves which scatter them into
          Earth&#39;s atmosphere. As part of a project with the University of
          Alberta, we&#39;re helping analyze data from the Swarm satellites to
          track and understand these waves. Our work is helping to build a new
          tool for monitoring space weather using Earth observation satellites.
